Educational-level 2D acoustic reverse-time migration (RTM) code

My code works as a tool for seismologists to quickly understand how RTM imaging method works in synthetic dataset. This code provides a few options to test your imaging results:

(1) back-propagation solver (reconstruction vs. adjoint)

(2) velocity model (true vs. smoothed)

(3) diagonal Hessian/source illumination (with vs. without)
